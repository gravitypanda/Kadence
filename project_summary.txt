# Meetkadence Codebase Summary

## Project Overview

Meetkadence is a "reverse CRM" application designed to help users nurture valuable relationships through AI-enhanced email suggestions. Rather than requiring users to manage a traditional CRM, it pushes suggested outreach messages directly to their inbox based on customizable cadences and categories.

## Project Structure

The project follows this structure:
- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application with dashboard interface
- `pages/`: Directory containing pages for contacts, categories, and settings 
- `models/`: Contains data schemas using Pydantic
- `utils/`: Helper functions and sample data generation
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies including Streamlit, pandas, python-dotenv, pydantic, and faker
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Key Features

The application provides:
1. A dashboard with metrics on contacts and upcoming outreach
2. Contact management with cadence settings and categorization
3. Category management with precedence ordering and AI instructions
4. System settings for email configuration and AI prompt customization

## Data Models

The system uses Pydantic models:
- `Contact`: Stores contact information, categories, cadence frequency, and personal instructions
- `Category`: Defines categories with description, rule text, and precedence order
- `CadenceFrequency`: Enum for weekly/monthly/quarterly/custom scheduling
- `SystemSettings`: System configuration for email and AI settings

## UI Implementation

The UI uses a sidebar for navigation with custom CSS styling to create a clean, modern look. The dashboard displays metrics using card-style components, and data is presented in expandable sections and tables.

## Current State

The application is currently a prototype focusing on UX/UI demonstration. It's functional but uses sample data rather than a database backend. Core functionality like email integration and LLM integration are simulated for demonstration purposes.

## Future Development Potential

Potential areas for enhancement:
- Database integration for persistent storage
- Email service integration for sending/receiving messages
- LLM integration for generating personalized messages
- User authentication and multi-user support
- Mobile responsiveness improvements
- Data import/export functionality
- Analytics and reporting features
